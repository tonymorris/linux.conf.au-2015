\begin{itemize}
  \item can fix bugs independently of the possibility of creating more
  \item can introduce features without adversely affecting others
  \item can have hundreds of projects requiring zero maintenance
  \item \textbf{avoid endless tail-chasing that prevails in corporate dev}

\begin{quotation}
The Marine Corps' F-35B aircraft are being delivered with Block 2B software, which Gilmore said has "hundreds of unresolved deficiencies." And those problems have compounded in Block 3F software. That's because the first round of Block 3 was created by "re-hosting the immature Block 2B softwareâ€¦into new processors to create Block 3i," the initial release for the code, Gilmore noted. This led to "avionics instabilities and other new problems, resulting in poor performance during developmental testing."
